Checkout page should have navigation bar on top, and bellow the container that has the list of all purchased products, with a button for purchase conformation, and a little form that has to be filled(probabbly a dialog).

- Use Material UI or Bootstrap components for this implementation.
- Checkout page should have a basket icon in the navigation bar.
